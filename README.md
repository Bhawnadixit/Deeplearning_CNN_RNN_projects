This repository contains Google Colab notebooks related to student projects in deep learning and AI courses to highlight my experience in AI using TensorFlow and Neural networks.

DL_GA_1: Designing and tuning a dense network. 
For this first assignment, the task was to classify the MNIST dataset, which consists of labelled handwritten digits. The objective of the assignment was to create and train a model that can generalise well for
unseen samples.

DL_GA_2: Classifying the CIFAR 100 image dataset with 20 classes.

DL_GA_3: Predicting pollution in the city of Beijing as a Citizen Warning System based on 5-year data from past pollution and weather using tuned CNN and GRU.

DL_GA_4: Music classification with deep learning by CQT, FFT, and STFT transforms (images of music), using pre-trained and fine-tuning different models.

Note that these assignments were performed in groups, so I have included common files and my contributions where relevant.
